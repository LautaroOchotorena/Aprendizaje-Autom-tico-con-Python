# Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

The **objective** is to create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors.

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Machine-Learning-with-Python-FreeCodeCamp/blob/main/Book%20Recommendation%20Engine%20using%20KNN/Instructions.md) are provided and the resolution
is given in [**colab**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Machine-Learning-with-Python-FreeCodeCamp/blob/main/Book%20Recommendation%20Engine%20using%20KNN/fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb).

You can also **check it out** [**here**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FCq1Q_TeTK1a6YQbpnNHWIku0jckVhxJ?usp=sharing) and run it without downloading anything.
