# Machine Learning with Python 
This is a **course** taken in **FreeCodeCamp**. To complete it, I had to create **5 projects**, which are stored in the folders. Instructions are provided for each project.

All the projects have a link to **run** the files **without downloading** anything.

**Main libraries**:<br>
Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow y Keras.
