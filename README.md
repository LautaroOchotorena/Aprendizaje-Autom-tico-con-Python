# Machine Learning with Python 
This is a **course** taken in **FreeCodeCamp**. To complete it, I had to create **5 projects**, which are stored in the folders. Instructions are provided for each project.

The 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' project can also be checked without downloading anything, just check it out here [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://replit.com/@LautaroOchotore/Rockpaper-and-scissors?v=1).<br>
