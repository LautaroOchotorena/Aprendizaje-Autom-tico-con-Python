# Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

The **objective** is to create a machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam".

[**Instructions**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Machine-Learning-with-Python-FreeCodeCamp/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20SMS%20Text%20Classifier/Instructions.md) are provided and the resolution
is given in [**colab**](https://github.com/LautaroOchotorena/Machine-Learning-with-Python-FreeCodeCamp/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20SMS%20Text%20Classifier/fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb).

You can also **check it out** [**here**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10ht8tFNqttVeerer1RMh_VTFjai68joO?usp=sharing) and run it without downloading anything.
